            The future of NFTs isn't just about collectibles—it's about
            creativity and ownership. My project introduces AI-powered NFT
            generation, allowing users to customize characters with unique
            traits, backgrounds, and rarities. This ensures that every NFT is
            not just another asset but a truly personalized creation.

            Beyond traditional buy-and-sell mechanics, my marketplace introduces
            new ways to engage. Users can choose between fixed-price sales,
            auctions, or an innovative investment model where multiple investors
            can fund an NFT, earning a share of its future resale. This opens up
            new possibilities for liquidity, accessibility, and strategic
            trading.

            By integrating blockchain security, anti-screenshot protection, and
            a live trading chart similar to memecoins, my project ensures that
            NFTs are more than static images—they are dynamic, tradable assets.
            This is a step towards making NFTs more functional, engaging, and
            valuable in the evolving digital economy.
